# GitHub Wiki Setup Instructions

Since you correctly pointed out that wiki pages should be in GitHub's wiki system (not in the repository), here are the instructions to set up the GitHub wiki with all the content we created.

## 📋 How to Set Up GitHub Wiki

### Step 1: Enable Wiki in GitHub Repository
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/rupesh43210/n8nDeploy
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Features** section
4. Check ✅ **Wikis** to enable the wiki feature

### Step 2: Access Wiki Section
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/rupesh43210/n8nDeploy  
2. Click the **Wiki** tab (should appear after enabling)
3. Click **Create the first page**

### Step 3: Create Wiki Pages
Create the following pages in this order (GitHub wiki uses the first page as Home):

#### 🏠 **Home** (First Page)
**Page Name:** `Home`  
**Content:** Copy from the content below marked as `[HOME CONTENT]`

#### 🚀 **Quick-Start**
**Page Name:** `Quick-Start`
**Content:** Copy from the content below marked as `[QUICK-START CONTENT]`

#### ⚙️ **Configuration** 
**Page Name:** `Configuration`
**Content:** Copy from the content below marked as `[CONFIGURATION CONTENT]`

#### 📋 **Command-Reference**
**Page Name:** `Command-Reference`  
**Content:** Copy from the content below marked as `[COMMAND-REFERENCE CONTENT]`

**Content:** Copy from the content below marked as `[FAQ CONTENT]`

#### 🏭 **Production-Deployment**
**Page Name:** `Production-Deployment`
**Content:** Copy from the content below marked as `[PRODUCTION-DEPLOYMENT CONTENT]`

## 💡 Tips for GitHub Wiki

- **Sidebar Navigation**: GitHub auto-generates sidebar from page names
- **Internal Links**: Use `[[Page-Name]]` for internal wiki links  
- **Editing**: Each page has an **Edit** button for updates
- **History**: GitHub tracks all wiki changes with git history
- **Collaboration**: Team members can edit wiki pages
